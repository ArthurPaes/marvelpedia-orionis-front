# Marvelpedia-Orionis-Front

## This project was developed during the [Orion Bootcamp](https://newrizon.global/bootcamp-new-rizon/) by the students under my direct [Supervision](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_CiVTruqsjSc2VHD_ftVLkXesNLoAH0C/view)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.6.

## Development server

This project is configured with `docker`. To run it you need to have Docker installed.

Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up` and wait for the message `** Angular Live Development Server is listening on 0.0.0.0:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **`

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code generation

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
